Respect gets respect.

Like most hackerspace and makerspace communities, members generally believe that the purpose of coming together is to learn through doing (aka "do-ocracy") and sharing without judgement or prejudice, and to treat each other with dignity and respect.

Every participant is responsible for conducting themselves in a manner which encourages others to share and pursue what they love and learn new skills from peers of all ages and backgrounds in a safe and supportive environment.

Here are a few obvious things that will not be tolerated during our events and activities:

- Sexual harassment
- Hate speech that singles out gender, sexual orientation, faith, or ethnicity
- Physical abuse of any kind, including damage and mistreatment of the facilities
- Attending the event with no effort to participate and or create something (ie, you want to sell or promote something with little or no emphasis on actually making or sharing a skill while you're there)
