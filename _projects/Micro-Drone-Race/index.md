Test your hand at flying one of our mini drones through our custom built light up course. Think you have what it takes to compete?

<!-- more -->

The micro drone (quadcopter) race course is built using [Particle.io](http://Particle.io) Photon IOT development boards and hoops containing WS2812 LEDs ([NeoPixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/overview)).
